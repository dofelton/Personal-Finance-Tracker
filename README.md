# Overview

This is a Python based software project that tracks personal income, expenses, and budgets. It connects to a Firestore Cloud Database.

I used this project to learn and practice setting up and utilizing a Cloud-based database and to learn how to utilize Python to program the functionality and interact with the database as needed.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of the cloud database.}
